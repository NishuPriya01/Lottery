# Lottery System in Python
This is a simple lottery system implemented in Python. The system allows users to register within a 10-second window, displays the list of registered users, and selects a winner.

## Features
- User Registration: A 10-second window is provided for users to register for the lottery.
- Display Registered Users: After the registration period, the system displays the list of all registered users.
- Winner : A winner is chosen from the list of registered users.

## How It Works
1. The program starts a 10-second timer during which users can register by entering their names.
2. After the timer ends, the list of all registered users is displayed.
3. The system also displays the winner selected from the list of registered users.
